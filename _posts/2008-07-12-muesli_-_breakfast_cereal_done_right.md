title: Muesli - Breakfast Cereal Done Right
---

Some of you might have seen those lofty boxes of muesli on the top shelf of the grocery store, and thought one of two things 1) Muese-what? 2) What could possibly in that tiny little box that makes it worth 6 dollars. Both I would argue are reasonable questions. Hell a few of you might even know what Muesli is, and more power to you, this delicious little breakfast of rolled oats was developed in Switzerland for use in hospitals (at least according the the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muesli">wikipedia</a> definition and if it's good enough for wikipedia it's good enough for me.) is a meal in cereal form.

## Directions for Making my hacked up concoction I call muesli

### Ingredients:

* Rolled Oats
* Walnuts
* Sliced Almonds
* Sunflower Seeds
* Flax Seed
* Dried Apples
* Raisins
* Cinnamon
* Nutmeg
* Dried Dates

Collect all the ingredients in a large bowl, mix and match to taste. (seriously) A couple pounds of oats makes enough cereal to last me a couple weeks. It tastes great served with milk/cream, soy milk, or yogurt. Topping it with fresh fruit like raspberries makes it a special treat.

If you like yours softer you can boil the milk (or water) first and it becomes more like oatmeal, if you like yours crunchier add some molasses (or honey or maple syrup), and bake it for 10 minutes.

And on top of that there's plenty of leeway for experimenting, some other things to throw in there that I like are.

* Dried Cherries
* Pumpkin Seeds
* Dried Soy Beans
* Currants
* Crystallized Ginger
