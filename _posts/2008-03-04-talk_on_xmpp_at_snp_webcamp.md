title: Talk on XMPP at SNP WebCamp
---

I Gave a talk on XMPP two days ago as part of the XNP webcamp in Cork, I attempted to make my <a href="http://anders.conbere.org/docs/xmpp/xmpp_presentation.html">Presentation</a> in the style of Lessig. The result is that these notes aren't particularly interesting, but I should have a link to the video up soon. The talk went very well and was quite exciting to give. I thought it had gone well after finishing it, but hadn't realized the impact it had until we had adjourned for lunch and a small group slowly grew around me to discuss the implications of real time messaging on their various ventures.

Overall a simply fantastic experience. Now to see if I can reduce my 20 minute talk to 5 and give it at ignite seattle :-D<
