title: BlogTalk2008 / SNP WebCamp Conclussion
---

I'm a Conference Newb, so I can't speak with great detail about how this event related to all the others in the world, but I can say I had a great time, met a ton of great people and solidified my relationship with others. I came away with a much better gut feeling on how the semantic web folks see the end game playing out, and the problems that I see with the current approach (It doesn't provide tools to capture the <em>dynamic</em> nature of social data, social networks need to be able to update a foaf file on a remote machine, not just aggregate it). I also arrived at an interesting to me realization of what I've found so disturbing about CrowdSourcing and how I aim to fix it.

Highlights were:

* Talking with <a href="http://danbri.org/" rel="friend">Dan Brickley</a> about FOAF and XMPP
* Meeting <a href="http://climbtothestars.org/" rel="friend">Stephanie Booth</a>. Freelancers check out her <a href="http://going-solo.net/">GoingSolo</a> Conference happening in May
* Meeting <a href="http://www.romefort.net/" rel="friend">Johann Romefort</a> of Seesmic
* Meeting <a href="http://captsolo.net/info/" rel="firend">Uldis Bojars</a> and the rest of the <a href="http://www.deri.ie/">DERI</a> Folk
* An interesting talk on the future of advertising
* An interesting talk by the <abbr title="British Telecom">BT</a> about Tidly Wiki
