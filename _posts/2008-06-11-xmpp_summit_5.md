title: Meat Flappings - XMPP Summit 5
---

I haven't been this excited about a hardcore geek meeting in ages. The XMPP Summit 5 coming up in July in Portland is revving up to be an incredible experience, we have an A grade cast of characters, everyone from processes one (developers of the incredible ejabberd), to Peter Saint-Andre (Executive Director of the <abbr title="XMPP Software Foundation">XSF</abbr>) to folks from Seesmic, EngineYard, and more.

Not only has XMPP been one of <i>the</i> hot topics this year, but there have just been some people really pushing the boundary of what XMPP has been used for, especially in the areas of social networking, and building real time distributed systems. And a whole slew of these people are going to be there. There are a few people I'd love to see get in touch with us and come down. Meebo, Google's folks say they're busy but want to make the next one, maybe the folks at fire-eagle! But in all I'm really happy with the quality of the attendees.

The talk on summit@xmpp.org has been about how to architect scalable xmpp systems, how to use bosh to make dynamic pages, how to federate social networks, how to use pubsub and more. There should be some great coding sessions and hopefully a lot of documentation.

So go check out <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/summit/summit5.shtml">the summit</a>, it's free, in beautiful Portland, and likely a lot of fun!
