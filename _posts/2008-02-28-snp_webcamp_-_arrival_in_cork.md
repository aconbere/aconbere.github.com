title: SNP WebCamp - Arrival in Cork
---

I arrived in Cork Ireland today. I'm safe, Jet lagged, exhausted, hungry, lost and all those wonderful feelings that come with traveling. I got to me room at a bed and breakfast around 1:00 (aka 5:00 AM) and promptly took a nice little nap and went exploring.

The city is nice, the weather is almost exactly like Seattle's, I still think irish beer is a bit bland, the people are friendly to a fault and it looks to just be a great town. That being said... if anyone attending the SNP/Blog Talk conference (or anyone in cork in general) is reading this, I would love to go get a beer and get some pointers on things to do /see.

Hurah!
