title: Xmpp-psn Client Available
---

Today I finished the first working xmpp-psn client, it's a small ruby module, and will let you talk http to a running xmpp-psn server anywhere to do xmpp/jabber. I don't have it in subversion yet, but it should be there soon as I clean up a few things and finish some testing. In all the performance looks to be pretty good, and it works :-D

A python client should be coming soon!
